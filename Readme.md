# Weather Data ETL Pipeline

A data pipeline that extracts data from thee openweathermap API, transforms the data into a structured format, and loads it into Amazon S3.

# Architechture of the ETL pipeline

## Overview

This project uses Apache Airflow to schedule and run a daily ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that:

1. Extracts the latest weather data from openweathermap API
2. Transforms the data by selecting relevant fields and formatting them appropriately
3. Loads the data into an Amazon S3 bucket for storage and further analysis

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Apache Airflow
- AWS account with S3 access
- openweathermap API key

## Required Python Packages

- pandas
- python-dotenv
- apache-
- s3fs
- apache-airflow-providers-amazon

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd weather-data-etl-with-airflow
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with your API credentials:
   ```
   BEARER_TOKEN=your_weather_api_key
   ```

3. Configure AWS credentials in Airflow:
   - Create an AWS connection in Airflow named "aws_default"
   - Add your AWS access key, secret key, and region

4. Create an S3 bucket named "sandesh-weather-data-bucket" (or modify the code to use your bucket name)

5. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install s3fs pandas python-dotenv apache-airflow apache-airflow-providers-amazon
   ```

## How It Works

### weather_etl.py

This file contains the main ETL function `run_weather_etl()` which:
- Connects to the weather API using api key
- Fetches the 10 most recent weather data with metadata
- Transforms the data into a pandas DataFrame
- Saves the data as a CSV file locally
- Uploads the CSV file to the specified S3 bucket

### weather_dag.py

This file defines the Airflow DAG that:
- Runs once per day
- Executes the ETL function defined in weather_etl.py
- Includes retry logic for handling failures

## Usage

1. Place the DAG files in your Airflow DAGs folder
2. Enable the DAG in the Airflow UI
3. The pipeline will run automatically based on the schedule (daily)

## Monitoring
You can monitor the pipeline execution in the Airflow UI:
- Check task logs for detailed execution information
- Verify S3 bucket contents to ensure data is being uploaded correctly

## Extending the Project

Potential enhancements:
- Add data quality checks
- Implement error notifications
- Add data visualization layer
- Implement data partitioning in S3
